 * This is a simple class for assembling polygons out of edges. It requires that
 * no two edges cross. It can handle both directed and undirected edges, and
 * optionally it can also remove duplicate edge pairs (consisting of two
 * identical edges or an edge and its reverse edge). This is useful for
 * computing seamless unions of polygons that have been cut into pieces.
 *
 *  Here are some of the situations this class was designed to handle:
 *
 *  1. Computing the union of disjoint polygons that may share part of their
 * boundaries. For example, reassembling a lake that has been split into two
 * loops by a state boundary.
 *
 *  2. Constructing polygons from input data that does not follow S2
 * conventions, i.e. where loops may have repeated vertices, or distinct loops
 * may share edges, or shells and holes have opposite or unspecified
 * orientations.
 *
 *  3. Computing the symmetric difference of a set of polygons whose edges
 * intersect only at vertices. This can be used to implement a limited form of
 * polygon intersection or subtraction as well as unions.
 *
 *  4. As a tool for implementing other polygon operations by generating a
 * collection of directed edges and then assembling them into loops.
