         * This method does not need to be declared strictfp to
         * compute the same correct result on all platforms.  When
         * scaling up, it does not matter what order the
         * multiply-store operations are done; the result will be
         * finite or overflow regardless of the operation ordering.
         * However, to get the correct result when scaling down, a
         * particular ordering must be used.
         *
         * When scaling down, the multiply-store operations are
         * sequenced so that it is not possible for two consecutive
         * multiply-stores to return subnormal results.  If one
         * multiply-store result is subnormal, the next multiply will
         * round it away to zero.  This is done by first multiplying
         * by 2 ^ (scale_factor % n) and then multiplying several
         * times by by 2^n as needed where n is the exponent of number
         * that is a covenient power of two.  In this way, at most one
         * real rounding error occurs.  If the double value set is
         * being used exclusively, the rounding will occur on a
         * multiply.  If the double-extended-exponent value set is
         * being used, the products will (perhaps) be exact but the
         * stores to d are guaranteed to round to the double value
         * set.
         *
         * It is _not_ a valid implementation to first multiply d by
         * 2^MIN_EXPONENT and then by 2 ^ (scale_factor %
         * MIN_EXPONENT) since even in a strictfp program double
         * rounding on underflow could occur; e.g. if the scale_factor
         * argument was (MIN_EXPONENT - n) and the exponent of d was a
         * little less than -(MIN_EXPONENT - n), meaning the final
         * result would be subnormal.
         *
         * Since exact reproducibility of this method can be achieved
         * without any undue performance burden, there is no
         * compelling reason to allow double rounding on underflow in
         * scalb.
