        // medians of the spherical triangle. It is possible to show that this
        // point is simply the planar centroid projected to the surface of the
        // sphere. Finally, there is the true centroid (mass centroid), which is
        // defined as the area integral over the spherical triangle of (x,y,z)
        // divided by the triangle area. This is the point that the triangle would
        // rotate around if it was spinning in empty space.
        //
        // The best centroid for most purposes is the true centroid. Unlike the
        // planar and surface centroids, the true centroid behaves linearly as
        // regions are added or subtracted. That is, if you split a triangle into
        // pieces and compute the average of their centroids (weighted by triangle
        // area), the result equals the centroid of the original triangle. This is
        // not true of the other centroids.
        //
        // Also note that the surface centroid may be nowhere near the intuitive
        // "center" of a spherical triangle. For example, consider the triangle
        // with vertices A=(1,eps,0), B=(0,0,1), C=(-1,eps,0) (a quarter-sphere).
        // The surface centroid of this triangle is at S=(0, 2*eps, 1), which is
        // within a distance of 2*eps of the vertex B. Note that the median from A
        // (the segment connecting A to the midpoint of BC) passes through S, since
        // this is the shortest path connecting the two endpoints. On the other
        // hand, the true centroid is at M=(0, 0.5, 0.5), which when projected onto

        // this triangle.
