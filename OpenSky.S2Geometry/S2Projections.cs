 * This class specifies the details of how the cube faces are projected onto the
 * unit sphere. This includes getting the face ordering and orientation correct
 * so that sequentially increasing cell ids follow a continuous space-filling
 * curve over the entire sphere, and defining the transformation from cell-space
 * to cube-space (see s2.h) in order to make the cells more uniform in size.
 *
 *
 *  We have implemented three different projections from cell-space (s,t) to
 * cube-space (u,v): linear, quadratic, and tangent. They have the following
 * tradeoffs:
 *
 *  Linear - This is the fastest transformation, but also produces the least
 * uniform cell sizes. Cell areas vary by a factor of about 5.2, with the
 * largest cells at the center of each face and the smallest cells in the
 * corners.
 *
 *  Tangent - Transforming the coordinates via atan() makes the cell sizes more
 * uniform. The areas vary by a maximum ratio of 1.4 as opposed to a maximum
 * ratio of 5.2. However, each call to atan() is about as expensive as all of
 * the other calculations combined when converting from points to cell ids, i.e.
 * it reduces performance by a factor of 3.
 *
 *  Quadratic - This is an approximation of the tangent projection that is much
 * faster and produces cells that are almost as uniform in size. It is about 3
 * times faster than the tangent projection for converting cell ids to points,
 * and 2 times faster for converting points to cell ids. Cell areas vary by a
 * maximum ratio of about 2.1.
 *
 *  Here is a table comparing the cell uniformity using each projection. "Area
 * ratio" is the maximum ratio over all subdivision levels of the largest cell
 * area to the smallest cell area at that level, "edge ratio" is the maximum
 * ratio of the longest edge of any cell to the shortest edge of any cell at the
 * same level, and "diag ratio" is the ratio of the longest diagonal of any cell
 * to the shortest diagonal of any cell at the same level. "ToPoint" and
 * "FromPoint" are the times in microseconds required to convert cell ids to and
 * from points (unit vectors) respectively.
 *
 *  Area Edge Diag ToPoint FromPoint Ratio Ratio Ratio (microseconds)
 * ------------------------------------------------------- Linear: 5.200 2.117
 * 2.959 0.103 0.123 Tangent: 1.414 1.414 1.704 0.290 0.306 Quadratic: 2.082
 * 1.802 1.932 0.116 0.161
 *
 *  The worst-case cell aspect ratios are about the same with all three
 * projections. The maximum ratio of the longest edge to the shortest edge
 * within the same cell is about 1.4 and the maximum ratio of the diagonals
 * within the same cell is about 1.7.
